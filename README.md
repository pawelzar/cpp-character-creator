# Character Creator
This is a small project created for Object Oriented Programming course at Adam Mickiewicz University. The application works in console. The goal is to create your own character. You can choose class of your character, add weapons and armors. There is also an option to create new weapon or armor.

Project was developed using C++ and is strictly descriptive (there is no graphics, everything is displayed in console).
